I learned to both write cin/ cout and printf/scanf from this lab.

I was already familiar with types/for/while/do-while from C#.

Indexation from the 'scanf_s()' was difficult for me to wrap my head around.

I didn't really figure it out more than that I managed to get the lab done.

I think that you should be more free to chose the approach to the Tasks,
but that the Problem would be more logical.
